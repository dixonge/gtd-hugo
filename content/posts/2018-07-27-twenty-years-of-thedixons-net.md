I can&#8217;t believe I have owned a domain name for its entire 20-year history! This main domain (thedixons.net) was first registered 20 years ago as of tomorrow, July 28. Here is a copy of the original domain name registration. $70 for two years! (click to embiggen)

I have changed the content so many times, it isn&#8217;t even funny, but the focus was always my family history. Here is one of the earliest screenshots of my home page, courtesy of [Archive.org][2]

Some interesting notes on that early version:

  1. That&#8217;s some seriously minimalist html there!
  2. Yes, my &#8216;blog&#8217; was called The Daily Rant &#8211; hand-coded w/ vbScript, ASP, served via IIS and MSAccess
  3. Yes, I had vacation pics and stories.
  4. Yes, I had a really cheesy web company name (WWW=World Wide Web &#8211;> Web Wide Word) &#8211; get it, I was &#8216;getting&#8217; the &#8216;word&#8217; out on the web!!! Genius marketing there&#8230;
  5. Oh yes, I totally coded the whole thing using Note Tab Pro.

Archive.org has grabbed 163 snapshots of the site in 20 years. There were periods where the site was not active as I kept changing my mind on servers, software and the overall focus.

I&#8217;m very proud of this, in a nerdy sort of way, of course. A personal domain was pretty rare back then. But I&#8217;m also proud at having the follow-through to still be here, with a renewed enthusiasm for the old days when one crafted their own content. This current [IndieWeb][5] initiative on this subdomain (glenn.thedixons.net) is one result of that. Who knows, maybe some day this section will have its own twenty-year history?
