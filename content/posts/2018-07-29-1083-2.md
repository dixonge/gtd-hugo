So I was scrolling through the [micro.blog][1] &#8216;discover&#8217; timeline and clicked &#8216;favorite&#8217; on something and it just accepted it. I didn&#8217;t have to jump through any weird 7-step authentication/approval steps. It just worked!

So I&#8217;m in. Yes, I&#8217;m also easy&#8230;
