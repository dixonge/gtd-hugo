Just a quick note to my new &#8216;community&#8217; on micro.blog &#8211; my feed might make it seem like I spent the last several months doing nothing but making posts about books I&#8217;ve read. In fact, I just imported my GoodReads into WordPress in draft status. The post dates were all matched to the date I originally finished the books, but when I set them all to &#8216;published&#8217; WordPress decided that the dates should be reset to the day I published them. And the dates aren&#8217;t available for recovery in the revisions. Eventually I&#8217;ll hopefully find a way to fix that, but in the meantime my original actual articles etc. have been pushed about 130 posts back in the timeline. So that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on, just FYI. ðŸ™‚
