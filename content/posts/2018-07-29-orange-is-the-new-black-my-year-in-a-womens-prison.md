So much more than the show!

<span class="a-size-base review-text" data-hook="review-body">Of course I read the book while picturing all of the actors from the series, those I could identify. But the true story behind the show is so much better! I found it both more informative and more hopeful. I think the main takeaway was a keen insight to just how broken the women&#8217;s prison system is, and I can&#8217;t imagine the men&#8217;s being any better. Legalize the drugs, and completely separate non-violent offenders. That seems like it would be a good place to start&#8230;</span>
