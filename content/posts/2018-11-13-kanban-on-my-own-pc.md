Decided I wanted to &#8216;own my data&#8217; when it came to projects. Needed to replicate Trello.

1 &#8211; installed Wekan. Easy peasy. Snap install. Imported Trello boards. All good.
  
2 &#8211; installed Restyaboard. Install script. Had to make a few decisions that I wasn&#8217;t sure about. Took 10-15 minutes. Imported Trello boards. All good.

There is really only one reason I&#8217;m going to go with Restyaboard. It may seem silly, but it&#8217;s the background images. Unavailable in Wekan.
