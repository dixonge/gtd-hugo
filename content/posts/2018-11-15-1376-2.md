Any reason I should _not_ go ahead and upgrade to Flickr Pro? I&#8217;m about to push the 1,000 photo limit in the next few weeks, and I have a few thousand more to transfer from what will become my &#8216;personal&#8217; photos over to my travel blog photos.

After that, I need to transfer the rest of my photos and videos up to one or the other of these accounts. After culling, will probably still be over 200GB
