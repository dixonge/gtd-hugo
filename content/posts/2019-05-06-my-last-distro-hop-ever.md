I know &#8211; I shouldn&#8217;t say silly things like that. But really, I&#8217;m getting close to setting a record here.

Again, the reasons for changing distros eludes me. Something about Lubuntu became problematic, but I don&#8217;t remember what. I think I even switched to regular Ubuntu for awhile, but eventually landed on [Linux Mint 19][1]. I&#8217;m now using that on both laptop and desktop. And when I got my new desktop box (a little [Zotac Zbox][2]) I moved the drive over and even _it_ just worked, no futzing around with drivers at all!
